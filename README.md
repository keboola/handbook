# THIS IS HOW WE ROLL “HANDBOOK” 

At Keboola we’ve built a culture based on: learning, innovation and MOST importantly trust. We also use A LOT of post it notes (don’t ask it’s just a thing), love our canine friends (so be careful where you step) and we take our coffee VERY seriously. 

Now for the fun stuff. Rules. we don’t necessarily want them, and if you’ve signed the dotted line to work here, people probably wouldn’t describe you first and foremost as a “rule follower” having said that something we’ve learned is that, in a vacuum, policies, dogmas and rules just kind of invent themselves. We’re not into this “birth of imaginary policies” so, we’ve outlined some areas at Keboola where we explicitly protect ourselves from the spontaneous eruption of rules.

This isn’t a handbook for what to wear for work (newsflash: we don’t care), or how to book time off(here’s an idea, get your stuff done and your boss will be excited for you to take a trip) or even what to do when you are sick (gee, I don’t know… maybe stay home and not get everyone else sick?) Again, we foster a culture based on trust, meaning you manage your own actions (within reason, of course). Scary I know. But this is what the kids these days call “adulting.”

Now, we don’t want you to think that we’re all play and no work - in fact, we pride ourselves at being great at both. The consequence of this non-policy policy is that your work must speak for itself. We’re not giving awards for racing into the office in the morning, or who stays the latest - output is what matters. Keboola is a place to produce.

We hope this guide answers some questions for you and helps you better understand how we roll at Keboola!. We ultimately rely on your good judgement and honesty to ensure the best possible working environment for all parties involved. You’re here because we want you to succeed and we hope this handbook helps ease you in on your first few days.

P.S. As stated above: we won’t implement any sort of expectations around what you wear to work but we do maintain the right to mock your choice of attire and send you home to change if you smell bad.

## A. KEBOOLA PHILOSOPHY AND VALUES

#### Care, love and respect 
Act with care, love and respect when interacting with our colleagues, our customers and the world. “You don’t know what you don’t know”, so be patient to help everyone understand the Keboola way. 

#### No BS 
We promote an open environment: open to critique, open to change, open to coaching. We own our mistakes and learn from them. No need to hide behind niceties, instead offer constructive feedback to address the problem. We value (sometimes brutal) honesty.

#### Get shit done and do a bit more 
Once you start something, it’s YOUR job to take initiative and finish it. Doing just what’s expected is never enough. When we go the extra mile, when we’re flexible and go beyond what’s expected - that’s when we add value and win. If it’s worth it, it makes sense. 

#### Create and innovate 
Explore, build and innovate - for us, for our customers - to always move forward. Have FUN with it. Be proud of what we produce. Be obsessed about things that make sense. We’re trying to create products that truly move the needle. Observe systems and always make them better.

#### Learn! 
Be a sponge! Have a growth mindset! Be proactive and naturally interested in the things around you - because let’s face it life is just better that way :) Become an expert and share your expertise with your colleagues and clients. When we aren’t learning, we are failing.

#### One team 
Our colleagues are spread all across the world. We don’t always have to agree, but we have to align. We’re all on this ride together.

To sum it all up to quote the infamous Buddha (it was Buddha, right?)… “Don’t be a dick.”

## Come One, Come All (We’re an Equal Opportunity Employer)

It is the policy of Keboola Data Services Inc. (“Keboola” or the “Company”) to provide equal employment opportunity to all employees, consultants, and applicants for employment, and not to discriminate on any basis prohibited by law. Here’s the thing: we don’t care what color you are, who you pray to, what gender you identify with, if you have tattoos or your hair is blue. We hire based on skill and culture fit. It really is that simple.

## Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)

Employees & contractors must not misuse confidential information, including internal and client information and communications. It is a condition of employment that the employee signs the [Company Name] Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement, which will be provided under separate cover. Confidential information generally consists of non-public information about a person or an entity that, if disclosed, could reasonably be expected to place either the person or the entity at risk of criminal or civil liability, or damage the person or entity’s financial standing, employability, privacy or reputation. The Company is bound by law or contract to protect some types of confidential information, and in other instances the Company requires protection of confidential information beyond legal or contractual requirements as an additional safeguard. Confidential information includes but is not limited to: 
- Payroll records, salary, and non-public benefits information 
- Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, state identification card numbers
- Credit and debit card information, and financial account information 
- Personnel records, including but not limited to information regarding an employee’s work history, credentials, salary and salary grade, benefits, length of service, performance, and discipline 
- Individual conflict of interest information 
- Computer system passwords and security codes 
- Information regarding client accounts including client information 
- Keboola’s internal business plans, tools, products, and strategy methods

## B. CONDUCT & BEHAVIOUR 

### Code of Conduct

Again, this is a workplace based on trust, and we entrust in you that as an employee of Keboola, you’ll exercise good judgment and implore honest behavior at all times. If you need more clarity than that, then “Act in a way that would make your mother proud.” We define good judgement as avoiding any behaviour that violates the law, is morally reprehensible, and anything that places yourself, another employee, or the company in harm’s way of any kind. 

In other words:
- Don’t show up to work intoxicated
- Don’t steal from us or our clients
- Don’t harass any other team member
- Don’t download inappropriate stuff to your work computer

Please feel free to (and we encourage it):
- Swear
- Laugh
- Share hilarious YouTube videos
- Bring your dog to work
- Bring treats for us as we like to eat often
- Treat others how you expect to be treated

Failure to follow our code of conduct may result in disciplinary action and even a boot out the door, and no one wants that so please don’t be an ass and you won’t get put in a time out.

### Harassment & Anti Bullying Policy

Keboola will not tolerate harassment or intimidation of Keboola personnel on any basis prohibited by law, including race, color, sex, age, religion, national origin, handicap, disability, marital status, sexual orientation, ancestry, place of origin, and family status or veteran status. 

Essentially, we have a NO ASSHOLES policy. We acknowledge some jokes might have a cultural context (ie pretty much anything the Czechs say :))) and should not be taken as an offensive action.

### Technology Policy

“Network and Electronic Resources”, such as computers, other hardware, software, email, landline and cellular telephones, and Internet access, are some tools that Keboola may provide you so you can actually get your shit done. This also means these resources and related access systems are Keboola property… so use them to work! We can access your. PLEASE don’t download anything illegal or *NSFW* as the kids are saying these days, so we don’t have to take away your access.

## C. THE ESSENTIALS

Sometimes things around the office can seem a little too good to be true. Snacks are plenty, coffee is a bit of an obsession and we often do team lunches! If we ever institute caviar-catered lunches, though, then maybe something’s wrong. Definitely panic if there’s caviar.

You should enjoy each and every day at the office. We do. If something is making you unhappy, speak up. Maybe we will fix it, maybe we won’t. Good chance we will though.

I case you didn’t know HOW TO USE THE DISHWASHER: 1. Open it. 2. Insert item in a way that makes sense. 3. Close it. 4. No, wait. That’s it. 

### Company-wide IT Systems & Tools

Even though the information systems evolve and change over time, here’s what we’re working with today:
- Google Suite (emails, calendars, document storage)
- 1Password for teams (password management)
- Slack (communication) Keboola Global: https://keboolaglobal.slack.com 
- Metronome for quarterly planning and goals
- Task Management and tracking system (Asana, Paymo)
- Salesforce (CRM)
- Asana for project management
- Outreach.io for prospecting

### IT Security and Computer Setup & Services

We’ve got a whole document showing you how to set up your security and computers, but you still might need a little help! If you do, reach out to Petr Simecek (EU) or Martin Fiser (NA):

[Keboola Internal Security Standards](https://github.com/keboola/handbook/blob/master/Security%20Standard.md)

## D. WORKING & COMPENSATION

### Probationary Period

Like all great relationships, we start with a standard probationary period. Just want to make sure you like us and that we like you! This is better than dating - you get paid. From date of hire, there’s up to a 90 day probationary period for full and part-time employees. Perhaps, “it’s not you, it’s us…,” and if either party feels that working at Keboola isn’t the right fit, either of us has the right to end the working relationship with no hard feelings.

### Employee Work Hours & Scheduling & Overtime

We work Monday through Friday. Sometimes you’ll find yourself in the office, or maybe plugging away from your couch or working from your favorite coffee shop - again, we trust you! Every now and again, you may be expected to work odd or extra hours on occasion. If you find yourself working extra hours often, we recommend you inform your Circle Lead. You’ll just work together to make sure that both you and the company needs are best served. Luckily for you, we easily make up for it with flexible time off… and again the opportunity to work in your PJs from home. 

### Working From Home 

The beauty of working in a tech company born in the cloud is that we’re pretty “location independent.” Again, we trust you (we say this a lot I know) - if you say you’re going to work while you’re taking a nice long vacation on the beach (or camping, or cross country skiing or raging at Burning Man… okay. Maybe just take a vacation day if you’re partying in the dessert), then just get your stuff done! Just let your Circle Lead know, be available and communicate! 

### Expenses

#### Business Expense Reimbursement Process

Keboola will reimburse team members for all approved necessary and reasonable expenses (sorry - not paying for any tickets to Disney World or for your Netflix subscription) incurred for Keboola purposes. In order to get paid back in a timely manner, properly document your expense report and submit to your Circle Leader for approval to be granted at least one week before the next scheduled payday. Otherwise, you’ll just be sitting around longer waiting for your money!

[Keboola Expense Reimbursement Form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yp6Su_6mSYAn_a--mwPrsbzc9fsMhQ9pekKwRDI_zKg/edit?usp=drive_open&ouid=103308068379278501745)

#### Approval Processes for Purchases

Your Circle Lead must first approve all purchases before the Keboola can issue a cheque or approve a Company credit card for use.

#### Cell Phone Reimbursement

In order to receive reimbursement for legitimate business calls made on your personal cell phone, you should speak to your Circle Lead and explain the nature of and reasons for the calls made; and provide a copy of your cell phone bill for reimbursement. 

## E. EMPLOYEE PERKS

### Health Benefits and Insurance Plan

Since this manual was born in Canada, we do recognize that we are global and this section is written with that as the default. Some benefits don't make sense in other countries, like private health insurance in other first-world countries with a well-functioning, national health care system. We will try our best to provide comparable benefits and perks outside Canada as it makes sense, though. For complete details about our benefits refer to your local office guru or Candy. Each country is different but in summary we offer a great package. 

### Go Learn Something! 

Keboola recognizes that the skills and knowledge of its employees are critical to the success of the Company. We encourage our employees who are interested in continuing education and job specific training to research these further and get approval before signing up for seminars and courses.

Keboola may offer educational assistance to those who wish to improve their job-related skills with prior approval from your Circle Lead under the following guidelines:

1. Minimum of six (6) months service accrued.
1. Must be a full-time employee (20 hours or more per week).
1. Employees who are students at the time of hire are not eligible for Educational Assistance for those subjects in a degree program they were pursuing at the time of hire.
1. Tuition shall be refunded for subjects directly related to:
  - The present work of the employee.
  - A position for which the employee is being trained, or
  - A position to which the employee may reasonably aspire to.
1. Expenses considered reimbursable include tuition and or registration fees for approved seminars. All expenses must be supported with actual receipts.
1. Reimbursement will be given prorated based on your completion grade. For example, if you receive a 90% mark then you will be reimbursed 90% of your tuition for that class to a maximum of $1200.00 per year.
1. You must obtain the approval of your Circle Lead or department head and the Human Resources Manager **prior** to enrollment. Please use the Application for Educational Assistance for this. To insure reimbursement, this form must be completed and submitted **prior** to enrollment in a course or seminar.
1. After you have completed the course, final grade verification and receipts for reimbursable costs must be forwarded to the Human Resources Manager.

The form can be found here: [Education Assistance Application](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OzL85hwACTJVl1GMgubwkjRKJJ0x3babxgfPRBdE-qI/edit)

## F. TIME OFF (HOLIDAYS, VACATIONS & LEAVES)

We have a "no ask, must tell" time off policy. This means that:
- While you don't need to ask for time off, it is always good to discuss it with your Circle Lead to avoid miscommunication and misunderstandings. Always make sure that your job responsibilities are covered while you are away.
- You don't need to worry about taking time off to go to the gym,take a nap, go grocery shopping, do household chores, help someone, take care of a loved one, etc. If you have urgent tasks, but something comes up or takes longer than expected, just ensure the rest of the team knows and someone can pick up the tasks (assuming you're able to communicate).

Come back refreshed, energized and passionate about what you do!
We don’t track sick days. If you are under the weather, take the time to rest and get better. You are no good to us sick so stay home and don’t share your germs.

## G. COMPANY OUTINGS

On occasion you may be invited to join other team members on team-building or other excursions. These excursions may involve engaging in some physical activities, or going out for a meal where alcohol may be consumed. If you feel uncomfortable with any proposed activity or excursion, please communicate your concerns to your manager. Your safety is our primary concern and if you feel like you cannot engage in an activity it is your responsibility to act in a safe manner. Keboola does not take any responsibility for any accidents occasioned to you while on any company excursions.

If you consume alcohol or marijuana while on a company outing, you must not drive or engage in any other activity where impaired judgment or motor control can compromise your safety. Don’t drink and drive or get into a car with someone who you think has been drinking. Keboola will gladly provide an alternative means of transportation to get you home safely. We also assume no responsibility should you behave in a manner contrary to this policy. Doing so would be dangerous not only to you but also to your fellow workers and may lead to immediate termination.

## H. HOW WE COMMUNICATE

We use a smorgashboard of communication tools: slack, in person meetings, the phone (not the old fashion ones), food gatherings and our monthly meetings. We are not heavy on emails, instead we rely on Slack (internal messaging platform) and our daily huddles to keep you in the loop. We will also shoot occasionally with a nerf gun to get your attention. You have been warned.

We don’t like to be too serious but we do have a serious side to our business and we do need to protect our clients so please read the following sections with all seriousness!

## I. ACCESS TO CLIENT SYSTEMS

Keboola’s business often involves having access to its clients’ software, hardware, data and other information or systems utilized or made available by client (“Client Systems”). It is critical that Keboola respect Clients System integrity, privacy and security at all times – Keboola’s business depends on it. As a result, Keboola requires all personnel who have been granted access to Client Systems to strictly adhere to the following policies and principles:
- Keboola personnel may only access Client Systems for the purpose of supporting Keboola in providing services to the client who’s Client System is being accessed. 
- Keboola may limit activities on a Client System to specific components of a system and specific time periods, and personnel must adhere to such restrictions. 
- Personnel shall not make any copies of client information unless previously approved in writing by Keboola or unless it is absolutely necessary to provide services to Keboola’s client.

- Personnel must control access Client Systems by using strong unique passwords and changing those on a regular basis. 
- Personnel may only access Clients Systems if they have a legitimate business reason to do so. 
- Keboola personnel shall dispose of all client information in strict adherence to Keboola’s instructions. Keboola personnel shall not erase, delete or modify client data residing on Client Systems without the express authorization of a Keboola manager. 

Keboola may instruct its personnel in safety, control, protection, and other policies and guidelines relating to specific Client Systems and personnel must adhere to those policies and guidelines.

## J. CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION

Keboola considers its confidential and proprietary information, including the confidential and proprietary information of clients, to be one of its most valuable assets. 

As a result, team members must carefully protect and must not disclose to any third party all confidential and proprietary information belonging to Keboola or its clients. Such protected information includes, but is not limited to, the following:

- Matters of a business nature, such as customer lists, customer contact information, associate information, on-site program and support materials, candidate and recruit lists and information, personnel information, placement information, pricing lists, training programs, contracts, sales reports, sales, financial and marketing data, systems, forms, methods, procedures, and analyses, and any other proprietary information, whether communicated orally or in documentary, computerized, or other tangible form, concerning the Company’s or its customers’ operations and business.
- Team members must ensure that any materials containing confidential or proprietary information are filed and/or locked up before leaving their work areas each day. During the workday, team members should not leave any sensitive information lying about or unguarded. If you have any questions about this policy, consult your supervisor or management.
- If a team member discloses any Confidential Information in contravention of these policies, that team member shall immediately notify a Keboola manager of such impermissible disclosure and use best efforts to mitigate the effect of such disclosure.
- Where applicable, personnel shall reproduce any of the Company’s client’s proprietary rights notices, in the same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original materials.

Disclosure of proprietary information of any kind can result is serious disciplinary action up to and including termination.

## K. SECURITY TRAINING 

Keboola requires every employee to read and confirm reading security guidelines, and some of its personnel to participate in security awareness training that will cover Keboola’s security policies, including acceptable use, password protection, data classification, incident reporting, the repercussions of violations, and brief overviews of applicable geographical regional laws and regulations including data privacy and protection.

## L. BACKGROUND CHECKS

Subject to applicable law, employees and consultants who will be working with Client Systems and client confidential information may have to pass background checks prior to performing services for our clients. Background checks may include the following checks: (1) criminal history; (2) credential / education verification; (3) employment history verification; and (4); professional reference check.

Employees shall also consent to Keboola sharing results of their background checks with some of its clients who request such information as assurance that Keboola personnel working with their Client Systems and confidential information are properly credentialed.
